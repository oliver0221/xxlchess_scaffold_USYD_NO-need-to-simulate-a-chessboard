Personal assignment to realize a 14*14 board without simulating a chessboard.
Report of the game
The design of my game, ChessXXL, is mainly divided into three layers: the board, tiles, and pieces. The Broad class represents the board. Here, I mainly implement the method of animated piece movement. The specific operation is to calculate the position of the piece in each frame and call it multiple times through the draw method in the main function app. The position is jointly determined by the starting position, specified movement speed, and maximum movement time, thus achieving the effect of smooth piece movement. Notably, I set up a movePieceNow method that moves the piece from one point to another without executing any animation, which is specially designed for the King's movement. In addition to the method of highlighting the check in red, the Broad class also includes methods for designing the overall board, such as pawn promotion and checkmate judgment. The Tile class mainly includes the rendering of each tile on the board, setting what piece should be placed in each tile, and determining whether to highlight the check in red, which is designed to prioritize highlighting the check-in red.

The core functionality of the game comes from the Piece class. It includes an abstract class Piece, two enumerated classes PieceColor and PieceType, and 11 subclasses representing different types of pieces. I first implemented basic movements in the Piece class, such as King's nine-grid movement, horizontal and vertical movements, diagonal movement, Knight's movement, and Camel's movement. Then, these movements are combined and modified in specific pieces. For example, the Amazon piece is essentially the movement of the Knight + horizontal and vertical movement + diagonal movement. Special attention should be paid to the Pawn and King. The Pawn piece has two different actions: moving two steps for the first move and capturing diagonally, so it's necessary to list a getPawnAttackMoves method separately. As for the King, I try to move to positions within the 9-grid (including capturing opponent pieces) to determine if moving to that position would put the King in check. This is a probing step, so no animation is required, and I use the movePieceNow method. I also designed a King-Rook swap judgment in the King class, with specific animation moves still implemented in the Broad class

The basic structure is as such. The AI is a relatively simple design. When it can capture a piece, it tries to do so, with the preference of capturing the piece with the highest value. Then it tries to move safely; if not, it moves randomly.

In the main class app, I mainly designed mouse click judgment, making it possible to display highlighting and text prompts correctly. At the same time, I implemented a countdown timer. When the countdown ends, the other side wins and the game ends. Pressing "a" resets the game to a human vs. computer match, pressing "r" resets it to a human vs. human match, and pressing "e" during a match will end the game with the other side victorious.

That's my basic design concept. Furthermore, since the images of the pieces are crucial, I wrote their paths directly in the initialization of the pieces. I also set up a series of protected methods to enhance security, so except for the Tile class, the rest of the classes cannot be initialized in junit testing, resulting in fewer test cases.
